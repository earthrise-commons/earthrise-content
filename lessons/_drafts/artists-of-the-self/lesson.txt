Text: [{"content":{"level":"h2","text":"Project Synopsis"},"id":"2fedf0f9-ae35-4782-9fd1-d5cedd09a9af","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>Students work together, cross-culturally, to analyze and interpret a short story in which a non-conforming or “social outsider” protagonist forges an identity for him or herself as a means of survival. Students in groups introduce themselves, establish community agreements, and assign members roles and tasks. Together, they create projects that examine culturally-specific attitudes towards non-conforming individuals as they are reflected in the literary works. Depending on the chosen text, students will explore challenges relevant to dominant patriarchal views on mental health, motherhood, gender expression/conformity, or sex work. As each of the protagonists resists imposed social constructs of identity and the limits on their freedom of expression, he or she works, as do the texts they inhabit, towards social change. Student teams create power point, podcast, or alternate media projects in which they present their story’s protagonist as an artist of the self who rebels against social pressures and creates a new identity. Each project will reflect on contrasting perceptions relevant to their protagonist’s particular struggle.</p><p>When taught in a Collaborative Online International Learning (COIL) context or a culturally diverse class setting, this unit provides opportunities for rigorous cross-cultural comparison of attitudes and values around topics important and relevant to students’ lives.</p>"},"id":"c8c0ea7c-be64-4dd5-b791-c9aac02e51cb","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"level":"h2","text":"Stage 1: Big Ideas &amp; Essential Questions"},"id":"20dcb925-d697-4a13-b1af-d893aa6f255a","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"level":"h3","text":"Established Goals/Content Standards"},"id":"e0bcbfc0-cd1b-423b-bfa9-69ed8532d2fe","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>What relevant goals will this design address?</p>"},"id":"935d09f7-e554-4552-b9a0-67466e353ab1","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"text":"<ul><li>Literary analysis &amp; interpretation</li><li>English language literacy</li><li>Written expression</li><li>Collaborative work</li><li>Intercultural competency</li></ul>"},"id":"713bcd14-e479-4e9b-b81b-5828a5dece95","isHidden":false,"type":"list"},{"content":{"level":"h3","text":"Understanding(s)"},"id":"de8a34dd-8558-40f3-886b-5637d9c279cc","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>What are the big ideas?</p>"},"id":"17588f0e-b4f7-48a7-a032-341203ae9949","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"text":"<ul><li>Cultural attitudes can shape the way individuals perceive and understand social systems and challenges.</li><li>These systems can be examined through a critical sustainability lens of relative environmental / social / economic thriving or (dis) advantage.</li><li>Literature read through a sustainability lens is a powerful way to hinge fictions to real-world counterparts.</li></ul>"},"id":"6428feec-9dac-4914-afd2-975c2bc07dea","isHidden":false,"type":"list"},{"content":{"text":"<p>What specific understandings are desired?</p>"},"id":"6c816b44-df8b-4417-b24b-cea2d6e15c4e","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"text":"<ul><li>Students will come to understand that their colleagues may hold contrasting attitudes towards the themes or character choices (plot points) in the stories.
