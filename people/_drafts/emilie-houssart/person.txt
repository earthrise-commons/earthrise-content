Bio: <p><strong>Emilie Houssart</strong> is an artist and curator based in upstate New York. She teaches printmaking and sculpture as a Lecturer at SUNY New Paltz, where she is a returning Sustainability Faculty Fellow and member of experimental collective <em>Eddy</em>. As a Dutch-British immigrant in the Hudson Valley, her land-based performance and living installation works disrupt psychic and physical legacies of colonizer culture, generating dialogue about alternative ways of being. Houssartâ€™s initiative <em>The DIRT Project</em> hosts playful, collaborative experiences for all ages to nurture relationships with subterranean life.&nbsp;</p>
